## What to do with software development downtime

<time dateTime="2019-01-03">03 January 2019</time>

Waiting on a long build or deploy? Blocked on your main task? Not at 100% brain capacity to work on your main task? Slow day in general?

Try doing any of the following:

- Ask colleagues if they need help
- Write docs
- Fix / refactor tests
- Improve test coverage
- Lint files
- Fix warnings when installing dependencies / running servers / app runtime
- Find and clean up TODO comments
- Create tickets / improve existing unclear tickets / delete irrelevant or old tickets
- Upgrade project dependencies
- Run benchmarks / profile things which are slow
- Reduce bundle or build sizes
- Remove dependencies on tools or external libraries
- Run audits for security or accessibility
- Use a screen reader or dictation software to find access issues in your frontend
- Test your frontends in obscure browsers
- Go for a walk and decompress a bit
