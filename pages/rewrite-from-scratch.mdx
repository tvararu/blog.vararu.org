**Edit 27/10/2016:** The c2 wiki is back online, and you can [find the original article here](http://wiki.c2.com/?RewriteCodeFromScratch).

The c2 wiki has been closed for "remodeling." It has a very good article about [good and bad reasons to rewrite code from scratch](http://c2.com/wiki/closed.html?RewriteCodeFromScratch). I hope the irony of this is not lost on the reader.

Until the page comes back up, here is the abridged version I saved to a text file a while ago:

### Good Reasons to Rewrite Code from Scratch

- Required changes cannot be made using the existing code base.
- We can't get the existing code to compile, or we can't even find the existing code.
- Nobody can figure out how it works.
- The architecture or underlying infrastructure is changing dramatically.
- It is so bug-ridden or ill-suited to the requirements that it is completely useless as-is.
- We are just doing it for fun or to exercise our development skills.
- IntellectualProperty or licensing issues make it desirable to stop using someone else's code.
- When the problem becomes too complex for the original language. For example, if I have a sed script whose complexity is getting out of hand, best rewrite it in some other language. Remember, not every program is "big".
- We are going to be held responsible for it over a long term, and are uncomfortable with accepting responsibility for the existing code base.

### Good Reasons to Avoid Rewriting Code from Scratch

- Nobody knows what all the features are of the LegacyCode, or what requirements it is supposed to fulfil.
- No tests are available to verify that new code is functionally equivalent to LegacyCode.
- There are more-important things we can do with our time than re-writing code that already works. We don't need to be ReinventingTheWheel.
- If the re-write takes longer than expected (and re-writes often do), then customers may move to other products/vendors.
- We can re-write it a bit at a time rather than throwing it all away.
- We have no reason to believe that a new team will do a better job than the original team did.

### Bad Reasons to Rewrite Code from Scratch

- It's really ugly.
- We don't like the coding style.
- We don't want to read it to figure out how it works.
- It's not done the way we would have done it.
- We don't like the people who wrote it. All their stuff sucks.
- It was NotInventedHere (unless you're doing so as a loophole regarding IntellectualProperty issues)
- It's too slow in some unspecific way. Better solution: find the hotspots (ProfileBeforeOptimizing) and optimize those. Only after quantifying the performance problems can it be determined that a total re-write is needed.

### Bad Reasons to Avoid Rewriting Code from Scratch

- We don't trust the developers to do it right. (This reason is even worse if it's valid.)
- My grand-daddy always told me "IfItAintBrokeDontFixIt."
