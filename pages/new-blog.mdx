  description="An overview of how I migrated my blog from Ghost to Next.js."
/>

I started this blog in 2014 using a [Ghost](https://ghost.org) instance hosted
on [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com).

While Ghost has served me well, [it’s been a bit annoying to maintain](/yak-shaving-ghost).
Also, paying 5 dollars per month for something that could be accomplished using
static pages is wasteful. Because I know how to write code, I don’t need a fancy
admin interface to write posts either.

After about 3 years of procrastination, today I finally got around to rewriting
my blog.

### Investigating options

I looked at [gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org) initially. I didn’t like the
reliance on the `gatsby` CLI tool, the complicated set of dependencies it brings
in (`graphql`? What?), or the weird defaults like coming with a `.prettierrc`
out of the box. I abandoned it pretty quickly.

I then went to my usual framework of choice, [next.js](http://nextjs.org), and
I looked at their [blog-starter example](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/master/examples/blog-starter).
It too seemed quite complicated compared to my needs: `babel-plugin-*`s that I
don’t recognise or know the purpose of, and lots of choices that I would have
to unpick one by one, such as the nesting of posts under the `/posts/` route.

However, I didn’t abandon `next.js`, because I knew it had good features like
[automatic static page export](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-9#automatic-static-optimization),
while also allowing me to sprinkle in React where necessary. As I knew I wanted
markdown support, I started from the [with-mdx](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/master/examples/with-mdx)
example.

### Building it

After initialising the project, adding a `.gitignore` and running `git init`,
there were a few other things I wanted to cram into the [`Initial commit`](https://github.com/tvararu/blog.vararu.org/commit/fcd1f4097ad5d98293d5934aa0b19b3d4bf194c9):

- a Cypress end to end testing setup, with some very simple but crucial
  assertions
- a `.circleci/config.yml` to run the tests in CI
- a `now.json` to deploy the resulting static pages to [now](https://zeit.co/now),
  and allow me to define `301` redirects for legacy pages, or create serverless
  endpoints for server-side logic.

After this, I immediately started importing my old posts, one by one. I decided
not to try to automate this, so that I can review each post one by one and see
if the setup is working.

I added in favicons (from my [main site’s repo](https://github.com/tvararu/vararu.org)),
refactored some parts of the layout, changed the `<title>`, and added an
additional test.

Ah, and [I completely disabled the single-page app aspect of `next.js`](https://github.com/tvararu/blog.vararu.org/commit/9f1169d8674f2b35fbb89540f93f481286ca09f4).
I did this by overwriting the `<Head>` element to not include any prefetching
logic, and by removing the `<NextScript />` declaration at the end of the
`_document` component.

This removes the React and client-side bundle that Next.js sends down the wire
by default. The only downside to this is that it removes the hot code reloading
in development. It’s not that important to me in this project.

The last thing to do was styling, which [I did in a pretty minimal way](https://github.com/tvararu/blog.vararu.org/commit/fd0911858ef16e66f7da5725cdf7726920c29c28).
I added in only the declarations that I felt I absolutely needed, and the
resulting stylesheet is less than 1 screenful.

### Shipping it

I ran a Lighthouse audit. The site scored 100/100 for Performance,
Accessibility, Best Practice, and SEO, all on the first try. Much better than
my old blog. This isn’t surprising given that every page is under `3KB` (total
size) and I’ve taken care to use good contrasting colours and not mess about
with styling.

To replace my old blog, I had only to remove the existing DNS entry, as I
already had a fallback `*` record pointing to `alias.zeit.co` which is where I
had been deploying the site while testing it. Couple of minutes, and it went
live.

There’s a few things I still need to do:

- add an RSS feed
- add meta description headers per page
- change the title per page

These can be done manually, but I’m just lazy. I’ll probably procrastinate
another 3 years or so and then get around to them.
