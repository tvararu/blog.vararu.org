## let javascript = haskell?

<time dateTime="2015-02-16">16 February 2015</time>

Today I found myself reading some JavaScript code and thinking, have I not seen this before?

```javascript
let square = x => x * x;
```

I reinstalled `ghc` and threw it in `ghci` for giggles:

```haskell
➜  ~  ghci
GHCi, version 7.8.4: http://www.haskell.org/ghc/  :? for help
Loading package ghc-prim ... linking ... done.
Loading package integer-gmp ... linking ... done.
Loading package base ... linking ... done.
Prelude> let square = x => x * x;

<interactive>:2:16: parse error on input ‘=>’
Prelude>
```

That's no fun. What _was_ the correct syntax, though? [Oh, right](https://wiki.haskell.org/Function):

```haskell
Prelude> let square x = x * x
Prelude> square(2)
4
```

Let's just view those side by side, harmless whitespace added for emphasis:

```haskell
let square = x => x * x;
let square   x =  x * x
```

So, if you remove "optional" (\*cough\* arguably not optional) lexical tokens such as the semicolon and the fat arrow parantheses, you'll find that **ES6 can be within a [Levenshtein distance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance) of 2 characters from Glorious Glasgow Haskell**.

Come to think of it, it could also be distance 0. Praise `let`!

```javascript
let number = 42;
```

Here's another similarity:

```bash
➜  ~  node
> 0.1 + 0.2
0.30000000000000004

➜  ~  ghci
Prelude> 0.1 + 0.2
0.30000000000000004
```

Can we keep going?

```bash
➜  ~  node
> ["10", "10", "10"].map(parseInt)
[ 10, NaN, 2 ]

➜  ~  ghci
Prelude> map (read :: String -> Int) ["10", "10", "10"]
[10,10,10]
```

Eh, I'm confident Haskell will eventually catch up.
