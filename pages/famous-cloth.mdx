## WebGL cloth implemented in Famo.us

<time dateTime="2014-10-14">14 October 2014</time>

Just look at this insane demo, between 4:45 and 5:30 in the [Famo.us Demo Day 6 video](http://youtu.be/tFPYq3_mu5o?t=4m45s). It turns HTML DOM into a physics-enabled WebGL cloth mesh. There are plenty more to see in the rest of the video as well, but this one takes the cake.

Earlier this year I stumbled upon [Marcus Eckert's tumblr](http://marcus-experiments.tumblr.com) where he posts phenomenal UX/UI experiments that he builds in iOS. When I saw some of his folding [cloth mesh](https://vine.co/v/MOWVvWZ2XOQ) [demos](https://vine.co/v/Mh5qd0HEpnt), I gave out a longing sigh, thinking that I wouldn't be able to reproduce this kind of experience for a pretty long while on the web.

Not even a full year later, I'm proven wrong.
