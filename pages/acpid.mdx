I've had a couple of unfortunate accidents where I removed my headphones from
my laptop only to have the entire cafe/coworking/airplane cabin rudely
introduced to my (patrician) music tastes.

To work around this, you can use a combination of `acpid` and `playerctl` or
`dbus`:

```bash
$ yay -S acpid playerctl
```

`playerctl` is just a convenience wrapper for [MPRIS media
events](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/MPRIS). You can skip installing it if
you prefer the long `dbus-send` commands that are listed in the wiki.

`acpid` is a daemon that outputs messages whenever things happen relating to
power or various buttons/lids on your device:

```bash
$ acpi_listen
battery PNP0C0A:00 00000080 00000001
cd/play CDPLAY 00000080 00000000 K
cd/play CDPLAY 00000080 00000000 K
jack/headphone HEADPHONE unplug
jack/headphone HEADPHONE plug
jack/headphone HEADPHONE unplug
jack/headphone HEADPHONE plug
button/lid LID close
button/lid LID open
battery PNP0C0A:00 00000080 00000001
```

To subscribe to these events and run scripts whenever one occurs, you can
create a file in `/etc/acpi/events`, for example:

```bash
$ sudo vim /etc/acpi/events/stop-music-when-headphones-unplug
event=jack/headphone HEADPHONE unplug
action=su - USER -c "env DISPLAY=:0 DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=unix:path=/run/user/1000/bus playerctl pause"
```

For a `dbus` related command like `playerctl`, you'll have to `su - YOUR_USER`
also export the display session and the `DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS`.

Start `acpid`:

```bash
$ sudo systemctl enable --now acpid
```

And that should be it, when you unplug your headphones `journalctl -fu acpid`
should show a message:

```bash
Apr 16 16:11:30 fwk su[373192]: (to deity) root on none
Apr 16 16:11:30 fwk su[373192]: pam_unix(su-l:session): session opened for user deity(uid=1000) by (uid=0)
Apr 16 16:11:30 fwk su[373192]: pam_unix(su-l:session): session closed for user deity
Apr 16 16:11:30 fwk root[373220]: ACPI group/action undefined: jack/headphone / HEADPHONE
```
