**Warning:** This post is a train of thoughts. At one point, I start ranting.
Later, I eat my own words. Enjoy the ride. ðŸš‚

Previously, I [tried and didn't quite like Blitz](/blitz).

New day, new kid on the block. [Remix](https://remix.run/) is a full stack
framework for building web applications using JavaScript. The contributors are
some of the bigger names in the community. The website looks promising. Let's
give it a go.

[Getting started](https://remix.run/docs/en/v1/tutorials/blog) is fairly
simple:

```bash
$ npx create-remix@latest
$ cd my-remix-app
$ npm run dev
```

The initial project skeleton offers some ideas of what it's about:

```bash
$ tree -I "node_modules|build"
.
â”œâ”€â”€ app
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ entry.client.tsx
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ entry.server.tsx
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ root.tsx
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ routes
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ demos
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ about
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ index.tsx
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ whoa.tsx
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ about.tsx
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ actions.tsx
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ correct.tsx
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ params
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ $id.tsx
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ index.tsx
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ params.tsx
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ index.tsx
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ styles
â”‚Â Â      â”œâ”€â”€ dark.css
â”‚Â Â      â”œâ”€â”€ demos
â”‚Â Â      â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ about.css
â”‚Â Â      â””â”€â”€ global.css
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â”œâ”€â”€ package-lock.json
â”œâ”€â”€ public
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ favicon.ico
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ remix.config.js
â”œâ”€â”€ remix.env.d.ts
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
8 directories, 22 files
```

So: TypeScript, `npm`, regular CSS files. `client` and `server` entrypoints.
Dynamic parameters via `$id` in the filename.

Looks sensible, but first reaction is if this is a full-stack framework, where
is the database? Maybe it's not "that" kind of full-stack.

No tests either, for probably the same reason: you can't satisfy everyone in
the JS community. I was complaining about Prisma being a default in [my Blitz
post](/blitz), so maybe it's better this way.

## SPA woes

Isomorphic React is used for writing the templates, which I like. JSX is still
my preferred DSL for writing views, because it's not really a DSL.

What I like less &ndash; and warning, this may come across as incredibly weird
&ndash; is that after I added a new route to `/posts`, and the application did
a pleasant refresh on its own, clicking on the new link triggers a client-side
route navigation.

Yeah, I know, why am I complaining about a React application behaving like a
single page application? Because I'm still holding out for the hope that, one
day, someone marries the developer experience of using React with *optional
client-side rendering by default*.

What am I on about? Single language, sane componenting, a good DSL for views,
hot code refreshes, predictable UI, types and props, pure functions,
scoped/purged/shaken/stirred CSS, but **without a 200KB bundle**. The accepted
default nowadays is that every application should start out as a single-page
application. After years of trying to make that work, I now firmly believe it
is the wrong one. **Client-side rendering should be opt in.**

Next.js, the current favoured server-side React framework, [does allow
disabling runtime JavaScript since a little while
ago](https://piccalil.li/quick-tip/disable-client-side-react-with-next-js/). I
use this feature right here on this blog. You, the user, would gain nothing
from being able to transition to the homepage of this blog without a request to
my server. The pages load instantaneously. A properly oiled, cached, statically
rendered multi page application is virtually indistinguishable in practice from
a SPA, for most use cases. But it is **so much easier to build and run**.

Well right, back to Remix, not to [another rant about
SPAs](/stop-building-client-side-forms). Maybe I'll find a way to disable JS
later.

## MVCing in the view

Pretty soon into the tutorial, I'm [mixing controller fetching logic right in
the view](https://remix.run/docs/en/v1/tutorials/blog#loading-data), executing
code on both the client and the server to load a couple of posts.

This is great, and it demonstrates why `jsx` is such a good language for
writing views and view-related glue code. Sure, it's not testable/maintainable
to do this forever, so of course they immediately show you how to abstract that
away into a proper model. But the fact that you can just prototype it so easily
before that is great.

Next up is a bit about reading markdown frontmatter using Node.js which
honestly feels a bit out of place and not really Remix specific. I didn't
bother implementing it as I didn't see what I'd gain. I caught on quite late
that the point of the tutorial is to implement a simple blog with Markdown
posts. The tutorial doesn't explicitly mention it at the start, but "Developer
blog" is the title of the guide that I could have noticed earlier.

CSS doesn't seem to be undergoing any special treatment, unlike `styled-jsx` in
Next.js and other similar frameworks. Just Webpack module-style imports.
Purging is left to the reader. Fair enough. There's so many ways to do it, this
seems like a sensible decision.

## Finally, some action

Getting to the Actions section, and building forms. Yes. I fscking love forms,
and it's refreshing that so do the Remix devs.

And holy smokes, they actually work without JavaScript! And it has errors that
ALSO work without JavaScript. Dear God, finally. I've been wanting this for
ages.

I like the design of the route action API. Not magical, colocated with the
view. Trivial to test, just a pure function. Really smart.

Then the tutorial ends. The next thing I went looking for is some configuration
flag to completely switch off client-side JavaScript in the production app,
while maintaining it for hot code reloading and other development concerns.

I found that the other tutorial, the [Jokes
app](https://remix.run/docs/en/v1/tutorials/jokes), does have some database
setup instructions. I still don't know if I like Prisma, but it's a choice.
Props for showing users of the framework how to do it regardless.

And I found what I was looking for as well! [Clean, clear instructions for how
to run a Remix project without client-side
JavaScript](https://remix.run/docs/en/v1/tutorials/jokes#javascript):

> Did you notice that our app isn't loading any JavaScript before now? ðŸ˜† This
> actually is pretty significant. Our entire app can work without JavaScript on
> the page at all. This is because Remix leverages the platform so well for us.

Wow. All you do is just add or remove `<Scripts />` from the root component.
And it's in the official docs, not a hack.

## Conclusions

Upon reviewing my earlier rant, I can confirm that Remix does in fact tick
every single box I mentioned that I was looking for. The day I was holding out
for has come.

For the first time in a long time, I actually feel an itch I haven't felt in a
while. That I want to take this tool and use it to build cool shit in my spare
time.

Chapeau bas. Good job, Remix devs.
