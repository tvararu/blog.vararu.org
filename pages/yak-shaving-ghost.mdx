## A yak shaver's guide to upgrading Ghost from 0.5.9 to 0.11.3

<time dateTime="2016-11-05">05 November 2016</time>

This isn't so much a technical guide as it is me venting about my latest yak shave.

[Ghost](https://ghost.org) kept badgering me to update so I decided, what the hell, I'm bored, let's go.

- Current version is 0.5.9, latest is 0.11.3, you need to do an intermediary update to 0.7.x.
- `wget` 0.7.1, install it by manually copying and `chown`ing files. Ponder why the maintainers don't have a script for this.
- Run it, seems to work fine. On to the `latest` release I guess?
- `wget` latest, do the copying dance again.
- `npm install` fails because my node version is too old for Ghost. My blog server is running node v0.10. So yes, it is ancient.
- `apt-cache show nodejs` has v0.6 as the latest available thing so that's a no-go.
- Attempt to install node v7, get an error when [piping curl to sudo bash](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) (!) that my Ubuntu is too old.
- Turns out I'm running 12.04. So yes, it is ancient.
- Learn how to do a LTS upgrade on Ubuntu and succeed after 3 badgering `curses` prompts asking for explicit user confirmation about changing `grub` and various other arcane config files and a reboot.
- Run `apt-cache show nodejs` for giggles, now the latest one is v0.10.
- Install node v7 successfully using their `curl | sudo bash` command. Eat your hearts out, security pundits.
- `npm install` fails because my node version is too old. What?
- `node -v` is still v0.10, node v7 was linked as `nodejs`.
- I'm losing my patience.
- `sudo mv /usr/bin/node /usr/bin/oldnode`
- `sudo ln -s /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/node`
- `npm install` fails because my node version is too new. Ghost decided to only support LTS versions, and hard fails when you use a newer one.
- Very long and drawn out sigh.
- Add `GHOST_NODE_VERSION_CHECK=false` to my shell in the hope that Ghost will pick it up when running scripts. Nope.
- Uninstall node v7.
- Install node v6.9.
- `npm install` fails because `ENOMEM`. My VPS is running 512MB RAM and doesn't have any swap.
- Learn how to add and use a swapfile on Ubuntu.
- `npm install` finally works and I'm running my blog again.

On the bright side, I learned two more things I'll probably never need again about Ubuntu.
